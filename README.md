# CT475 SVM Algorithm

Using a file called “owls.csv”, each line of file describes one type of Owl found in Ireland: body-length, wing-length, body-width, wing-width, type. There are three types: Barn Owl, Snowy Owl & Long-Eared Owl. This classifier is to distinguish between them.

## Results

### Figure1
Plot of the characteristics of the owl (body-length, wing-length, body-width, wing-width) against the species of the owl (Barn Owl, Snowy Owl, Long-Eared Owl). Characteristics on x axis, species on y axis

### Figure 2
Two species of owls compares. The numbers you see with optimal solution is what’s known as the QP problem
